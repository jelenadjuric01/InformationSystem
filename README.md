Information system that uses REST API and JMS for communicating between server and three subsystems. 

A video viewing system is being observed. The system has users, and for each user, the system stores their name, email, age, gender, and location. For the location, the name of the place is stored. A user can upload a video when they are its owner. For each video, the system stores the title, duration, owner, and the date and time of upload. A video can belong to multiple categories. For each category, the name is stored. The system provides users with packages, and the current prices at the monthly level are stored for each package. A user's subscription to a package lasts one month. For the subscription, the system stores which user is subscribed to which package, the date and time the subscription started, and the price paid for the subscription. It is not possible to create a subscription if the user already has an active subscription. The subscription is paid at the current price for the package the user subscribes to. The user can watch a video, and the system stores the date and time when the viewing started, the second of the video from which the viewing began, and how many seconds of the video were watched. The user can rate the video with a score from 1 to 5, and the system stores the date and time the rating was given.
